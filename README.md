Overview:
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based sentiment analysis system to classify customer reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms.

 Problem Definition:
The aim of this project is to automate the analysis of large textual data, such as customer reviews, to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). The challenge is to preprocess the data, extract features, and train models that can accurately classify sentiments.

 System Architecture:
The system follows these main steps:
1. Data Input: Collecting customer reviews or social media data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization).
3. Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical features.
4. Model Training: Training machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest on the dataset.
5. Model Evaluation: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.
6. Sentiment Prediction: Classifying the sentiment of new textual data.

 Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into machine learning models, it undergoes the following steps:
- Tokenization: Breaking the text into individual words.
- Stop-word Removal: Removing common but irrelevant words like "the," "is," "in."
- Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form (e.g., "running" to "run").
- TF-IDF: Converting the text into numerical values based on word frequency.

 Algorithms Used
1. Logistic Regression: Used for binary and multi-class classification problems.
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM): Classifies data points by finding an optimal hyperplane.
3. Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees for better accuracy.

 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy: Measures how many correct predictions the model makes.
- Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions.
- Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positive cases.
- F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

 Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: 
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `nltk`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`

 Installation
 
  Clone the repository:
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
   
Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
    Prepare your dataset in CSV format.
    Run the sentiment analysis script:
        python sentiment_analysis.py
The results will display accuracy and other performance metrics.

Future Work:

Implement deep learning models like LSTM and BERT for more advanced sentiment analysis.
Extend the system to analyze real-time social media streams.
